        <h1>Cheesburger Recipe</h1>

        <h2><b>Description</b></h2>
        <p>The cheesburger is the perfect vessel. Every since high school, the cheeseburger
            has been my go-to meal. While making a good cheeseburger isn't super hard, making
            a bad cheeseburger is incredibly easy. Recently, tons of burger joints have been
            opening up in my area, and with them has come a slew of burgers that can be best
            described as pretentious. Too often the problem with these burgers is an 
            over-emphasis on the toppings while neglecting the the star of the show, the patty.
            My hope is to guide people through the process of making a humble, but delicious 
            burger. No arugula, swiss cheese, or (heaven forbid) caviar. Just a plain, tried and
            true American cheeseburger. Enjoy.
