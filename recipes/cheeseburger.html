        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
        <p class="description">The cheesburger is the perfect vessel. Every since high school, the cheeseburger
            has been my go-to meal. While making a good cheeseburger isn't super hard, making
            a bad cheeseburger is incredibly easy. Recently, tons of burger joints have been
            opening up in my area, and with them has come a slew of burgers that can be best
            described as pretentious. Too often the problem with these burgers is an 
            over-emphasis on the toppings while neglecting the the star of the show, the patty.
            My hope is to guide people through the process of making a humble, but delicious 
            burger. No arugula, swiss cheese, or (heaven forbid) caviar. Just a plain, tried and
            true American cheeseburger. Enjoy.

        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>Preheat griddle to medium high heat</li>
            <li>Lightly oil griddle and start to grill onions. Be sure to season them with salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Remove onions from griddle after they're soft and put aside for later.</li>
            <li>Separate ground beef into 1/6 lb balls. Should have 8 balls.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat of griddle to high.</li>
            <li>Place balls of ground beef on the griddle and use press to flatten them</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper the tops of the patties to taste. This is the only time you'll season the meat, so make sure you use enough.</li>
            <li>After 3-5 mins prepare to flip the patties by using the previosuly grilled onions to make four small piles of onions on the griddle.</li>
            <li>Flip four of the eight patties on top of the onions. Flip the other four on the griddle normally.</li>
            <li>Immediately top each patty with American cheese</li>
