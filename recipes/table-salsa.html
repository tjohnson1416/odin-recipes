        <h2><b>Description</b></h2>
        <p>
            My wife have been married for over 5 years now. Early in our marriage we took
            a trip to Oregon and visited the famous Powell's City of Books. To be honest,
            I am not much of a reader, but we ended up buying a book about table salsas and
            moles from Mexico. We didn't think much it until we tried a recipe for roasted 
            table salsa, which was so good that we now make it at least a couple times a
            month. I share this in the hopes that this salsa makes others as happy as it
            makes us.
